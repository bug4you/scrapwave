✅ Finds and extracts links and images.  
✅ Handles POST requests with form data.  

## 🎯 Upcoming Features

📥 File downloading capability.  
📂 Structured data export (JSON, CSV, etc.).  
🔒 Improved security and rate-limiting features.  

## 🛠 How to Test  
While ScrapWave is in development, you can test it locally:  
```sh
npm install  # Install dependencies
npm run build  # Build the project

```
